<h2 class="paragraph_style_1">FOUNDER, CHIEF SCIENCE OFFICER, MEDCOMMONS INC; BEDFORD, MA — 2004-2011</h2>
<p class="paragraph_style_2">MedCommons is an on-line service for the transfer, storage and display of health records including radiology images. This is a major enhancement for physician and patient portals including electronic health records (EHR), personal health records (PHR) and health information exchanges (HIE). The system adds a Web radiology viewer and a secure on-demand DICOM connector to a cloud-hosted patient health record meeting all of the severe ARRA-HITECH consent, privacy and security regulations. This patient-centered approach solves privacy and consent problems and allows anyone to deliver results with browser-accessible links into the EMR or Inbox of any physician or patient by effectively using the Web and the National Health Information Network. The system is in use at Massachusetts General Hospital and elsewhere in support of radiology labs and clinical trials.</p>

<h2 class="paragraph_style_1">FOUNDER, CHIEF TECHNOLOGY OFFICER, AMICAS INC; BOSTON MA   — 1996-2003</h2>
<p class="paragraph_style_2">AMICAS is the first web-based picture archiving and communications system (PACS) able to replace radiology film with digital images delivered in seconds. Incubated at Massachusetts General Hospital, it introduced the first use of advanced compression in a FDA regulated medical device and the introduction of imaging links in legacy hospital information systems. AMICAS went public as NASD: AMCS and was acquired in 2010 for $248 million.</p>

<p class="paragraph_style_2">My commercial diagnostic medical device career began as director of the project that developed the first point-of-care blood electrolytes analyzer. This highly successful product was arguably the first to employ modern embedded software and high-level languages to achieve total automation with a very simple user interface. This award-winning design has been extensively copied and survives in the marketplace to this day.</p>
